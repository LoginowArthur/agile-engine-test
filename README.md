# Agile Engine Code Challenge

## Get started:
* Clone the repo
* Inside the repo folder move to photos-gallery-app
* Run npm install
* Run ng serve


## Features: 
* User is able to get the content of and specific page (only existing values, validation of the page number wasnt possible inside the time frame)
* User is able to get the specific data of each image by clicking on them

## To Do: 
* render the image request result.
* create a simple cache to avoid requests for data that was previously requested .
* add a catch to observables that make requests, in order to get a new bearer token in case the existing one expires.

### Notes:
As the instructions said, this is what I was able to do in a *little more than two hours*
